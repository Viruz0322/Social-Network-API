# Social Network API



## User Story
MongoDB is a popular choice for many social networks due to its speed with large amounts of data and flexibility with unstructured data.

This backend application is an API for a social network web application where users can share their thoughts, react to friendsâ€™ thoughts, and create a friend list. The following tools are used: Express.js for routing, a MongoDB database, and the Mongoose ODM. Specifically, the Express.js and Mongoose packages.

## Installation

# Setup (if git and node are already installed, you may skip):
For Windows, please download and install git and Node.js.

macOS users will need to install Homebrew. Then, run brew install git to install git, and brew install node to install Node.js.

Linux/BSD users should use their appropriate package managers to install git and Node.js, or build from source if you swing that way.

After that, clone the Application.

When the cloning is done, open the Integrated Terminal in the respective directory.

Run the following command in the terminal to install the packages:

npm install

This app uses Mongoose so installing MongoDB, that is also part of the setup.

To send the API calls, it would be very useful to download an API client (ie. Insomnia)
## Usage

Run 

npm run dev

Now you can connect with your API client(insomnia)
